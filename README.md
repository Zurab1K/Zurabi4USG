# USG Senate Campaign Website

This repository contains the official campaign website I created for my Undergraduate Student Government (USG) Senate campaign at Stony Brook University. The site is a single, responsive page built with HTML and CSS, designed to introduce myself to the student body, share my campaign vision, and provide all necessary information for students to engage with the election process.
